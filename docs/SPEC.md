# NEXG App — Project Specification

**Version:** 2.2.0
**Date:** 2026-09-22
**Live:** https://nexgapp.com
**Repository:** `C:\Users\limta\Downloads\nexg-concierge`

This document describes what the product **is**. For the state of the work — what is deployed,
what is broken, and what to do next — read [`HANDOFF-2026-09-22.md`](./HANDOFF-2026-09-22.md).

## 1. What this is

A consumer marketplace for Nairobi, Kenya. One app to browse and buy across food, groceries,
pharmacy, spa, transport, property and experiences — with separate onboarding flows for the
merchants, couriers and hosts who supply it.

The distinguishing idea is **breadth in one surface**: a user does not install five apps for
dinner, a massage, an airport transfer and a grocery run. They open NEXG, and the catalogue
spans all of it.

**Positioning:** premium and concierge-led rather than discount-led. The copy speaks about
curation and discretion; the brand colour is gold on near-black.

### Who uses it

| Role | What they do |
| --- | --- |
| **Consumer** | Browse, search, order, track, book |
| **Merchant** | Onboard, list items, receive and fulfil orders |
| **Courier** | Onboard, accept deliveries, navigate, complete |
| **Host** | List properties |
| **Admin** | Financials, merchants, inventory, commissions, content |

---

## 2. Catalogue

**Generated, not authored.** This matters more than any other single fact about the data.

```
21 categories · 128 subcategories · 640 merchants · 6,000 items
```

Produced by `scripts/parse_excel_to_db.py` from a spreadsheet into `src/db/seed_excel.sql`,
which is the single source of truth. The merchant names and item titles are **synthetic** —
"Atlas Appliances House", "Japanese Miyazaki A5 Wagyu Ribeye Cut" — generated to fill the
catalogue with plausible variety.

**Consequence:** merchant detail pages have **no real menu sections**. Every merchant shows the
same generic structure because the generator produced items without authored grouping. This is
the highest-value data problem in the project and no amount of frontend work fixes it.

### The 21 categories

```
Adults Only · Airport Transfers · Alcohol & Beverages · Beauty
Concierge Services · Experiences · Fashion & Apparel · Financial Services
Flowers & Gifts · Groceries & Essentials · Health · Laundry & Cleaning
Logistics & Shipping · Marketplace · Pharmacy · Restaurants & Food
Tech & Electronics · Travel & Tours · Vehicle Rentals · Vehicle Services · Wellness
```

## 3. Technology

| Layer | Choice | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI | React 19 | — |
| Build | Vite 6 | Fast, and the image pipeline already depended on it |
| Styling | Tailwind v4 via `@tailwindcss/vite` | CSS-first config, no JS config file |
| Motion | Motion **and** react-spring | See the boundary rule below |
| Server | Express 4 | One process serving both API and SPA |
| Database | PostgreSQL 15 | — |
| Runtime | Node 24 | Runs `server/*.ts` natively, strip-only |
| Deployment | Docker Compose, nginx in front | — |

### Two animation libraries, one rule

**One library per component subtree.** Both write `transform` and `opacity`; two writers on one
node means the last one wins and the result depends on mount order.

- **react-spring** — gesture-driven and interruptible motion. The docked search bar.
- **Motion** — declarative enter/exit, list transitions.

Full reasoning in [`ANIMATION.md`](./ANIMATION.md).

### The single-port decision

The Express process serves the built SPA **and** the API on one port. The previous stack used
nginx for static files plus a separate PHP-FPM pool for the API, which meant two things to keep
in sync. One origin also means no CORS in production and a session cookie that just works.

## 4. Architecture

```
                    ┌──────────────────────┐
   visitor ──TLS──▶ │  Cloudflare (proxy)  │
                    └──────────┬───────────┘
                               │ HTTP  (see HANDOFF §5.1 — this leg is NOT encrypted)
                    ┌──────────▼───────────┐
                    │  nginx  :80          │  /etc/nginx/sites-available/nexgapp.com
                    └──────────┬───────────┘
                               │ proxy_pass
                    ┌──────────▼───────────┐
                    │  app   127.0.0.1:3101│  Express: API + built SPA
                    └──────────┬───────────┘
                               │ DATABASE_URL
                    ┌──────────▼───────────┐
                    │  postgres 127.0.0.1:5433 │
                    └──────────────────────┘
```

Both containers publish on **loopback only**. Nothing but nginx is reachable from the internet.

### Middleware order — load-bearing

```
securityHeaders   headers present even on a rejection
observability     must see every request, before anything can reject it
rateLimit         after observability, so a blocked request is still counted
client identity   resolved once, reused by later consumers
express.json      body parsing
routes
```

Rate limiting sits **after** observability deliberately: ordered the other way, an attack would
be invisible in the metrics, which is exactly when you want to see it.

### Server modules

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `index.ts` | Wiring, routes, static serving |
| `security.ts` | Rate limiting, security headers, client identity |
| `observability.ts` | Spans, metrics, traces, telemetry ingestion |
| `tracing.ts` | W3C `traceparent`, span lifecycle |
| `logger.ts` | Structured JSON, child loggers with bindings |
| `repository.ts` | All SQL |
| `db.ts` | Pool, readiness, fallback detection |
| `auth/` | `routes.ts`, `session.ts`, `crypto.ts` |
| `version.ts` | Build metadata |

### Data-source fallback

If Postgres is unreachable the API **serves the bundled JSON catalogue** and says so via
`source` in `/api/health`. Useful in development, dangerous in production: a misconfigured
`DATABASE_URL` produces a healthy-looking app serving stale data. **Always check `source`.**

## 5. Features

### Discovery and search

The browse surface. Live search, a horizontal category rail with emoji, subcategory chips, sort
control, infinite scroll, and merchant cards.

### Home

Hero with a rotating service line, docked search bar, category rail, sponsored carousel, promo,
how-it-works, features, merchant ad carousel.

The hero rotates seven lines: **Relax · Cravings · Rides · Stock Up · Experiences ·
Exclusive 18+ · Membership**. Each is a lead word plus a support line, with the lead 5% larger
so the eye lands on it first.

### Merchant page

Hero image, rating, hours, minimum order, delivery estimate, item list, add-to-cart, cart
drawer, checkout.

### Onboarding — three flows

Merchant, Courier, Host. Each is a multi-step form: details, documents, review, submit. Draft
state persists locally so a half-finished application survives a refresh.

### Commerce modes

Merchants carry a mode — order-and-deliver, booking, enquiry — and the UI adapts. A spa booking
and a grocery order are not the same flow and the item sheet knows the difference.

### Auth

Email and password. **scrypt** hashing with parameters stored in the hash. HS256 JWT in an
`httpOnly` `SameSite=Lax` cookie. CSRF via an `Origin` check. Details in [`AUTH.md`](./AUTH.md).

### Observability

In-process spans, metrics and traces exposed at `/api/metrics` and `/api/traces`, with a
developer dashboard. Spans are **OpenTelemetry-shaped** (W3C `traceparent`, spanId) so wiring an
external collector is configuration rather than a rewrite. See
[`OBSERVABILITY.md`](./OBSERVABILITY.md).

### Consent and privacy

A cookie banner gates analytics and marketing categories separately from strictly-necessary
storage. Consent is stored client-side and read by telemetry.

## 6. Design system

### Type

| Role | Family | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Display / headings | **Quicksand** variable | `wght` axis **stops at 700** |
| Body | **Inter** | |

**Weight has a ceiling.** Quicksand's axis ends at 700, which is where headings already sit.
`font-black` (900) renders **synthetic** bold — smeared counters, uneven stroke — which reads
*lighter*, not heavier. To go bolder, buy weight optically: scale, leading, ink.

A Material 3 type scale drives the roles: display 57px/1.12/−0.0044em, headline 28px/1.29,
title 22px/1.27, body 1.5/+0.031em.

### Colour

Gold `#F8A61E` on near-black `#111315`, with a light theme. Brand gold is constant across
themes.

**Tailwind v4 does not generate opacity modifiers for custom theme colours.** `bg-gold/12`
compiles to **nothing**, silently. Use the `--color-gold-tint` and `--color-gold-line` tokens.

### The logo

`LogoIcon` renders the supplied artwork as **inline SVG** with two variants:

- **`mark`** — the gold G with the bell, square. For slots that show the name in text.
- **`wordmark`** — NEXG including the mark. For standalone use.

Aspect ratio is **2.64:1** (361×137), so it sizes by height with `w-auto`. A fixed square box
squashes it, and anything under ~28px tall is not legible.

The letters are near-black in the artwork, so the wordmark sets its own ink — near-black on
light, white on dark. It does **not** inherit `currentColor`, because call sites pass accent
colours that would tint the letters.

The favicon is the mark alone: `public/favicon.svg` and `favicon-dark.svg`.

### Layout rules

- Public surfaces are dark by default.
- Cards are rounded and generous; the reference is Wolt.
- Section rhythm around 48px between blocks.
- Tap targets are at least 44px.

## 7. API

All under `/api`. Full contract in [`API.md`](./API.md).

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/health` | Status and **data source** |
| GET | `/api/version` | Build metadata |
| GET | `/api/categories` | Categories with nested subcategories |
| GET | `/api/merchants` | Paged merchants; `category`, `q`, `limit`, `offset`, `sort` |
| GET | `/api/merchants/:id` | One merchant with items |
| GET | `/api/search` | Cross-catalogue search |
| GET | `/api/areas` | Delivery areas |
| POST | `/api/auth/signup` | Create account |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Sign in |
| POST | `/api/auth/refresh` | Rotate session |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | Sign out |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | Current user |
| POST | `/api/leads/email` | Lead capture |
| GET/POST | `/api/telemetry` | Client events |
| GET | `/api/metrics` | Metrics, JSON or `?format=prometheus` |
| GET | `/api/traces` | Recent spans |

### Rate limits

Keyed on **both** IP and device; a request passes only if both are under their ceiling.

| Route family | Per device | Per IP | Window |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /api/auth/{login,signup,refresh}` | **10** | 100 | 15 min |
| `POST /api/leads/email` | 20 | 200 | 60 min |
| telemetry, metrics, traces | 120 | 1,200 | 60 min |
| other `/api/` | 300 | 3,000 | 60 min |

**The ceilings differ on purpose.** One shared tight number means a single egress IP with ten
users behind it locks out the eleventh — and shared egress is not an edge case: mobile carrier
NAT, corporate networks and campus wifi all put thousands of people behind one address.

**Known limit:** counters are in-memory. Two instances make the effective limit
`max × instances`; serverless may never fire it. Both failures are silent.

## 8. Security posture

| Control | State |
| --- | --- |
| HTTPS | Cloudflare to visitor; **origin leg is plaintext** — see HANDOFF §5.1 |
| Public ports | 22, 80 only |
| Backend | loopback only, not reachable from the internet |
| SSH | key-only, `PermitRootLogin prohibit-password`, `MaxAuthTries 3` |
| fail2ban | active |
| Unattended upgrades | enabled and active |
| Security headers | CSP, HSTS, nosniff, DENY, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy |
| `X-Powered-By` | removed |
| Rate limiting | per device and per IP |
| Passwords | scrypt |
| Sessions | httpOnly, SameSite=Lax, CSRF Origin check |
| Debug mode | `false` in production |

`style-src` allows `'unsafe-inline'` **deliberately** — Motion and react-spring set inline
styles every frame and Vite injects its stylesheet at runtime. `script-src` does **not** get the
same concession, and it is the directive that actually stops XSS. Reasoning in
[`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

---

## 9. Quality gates

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit                    # types
npm test                            # 53 unit
node scripts/api-contract-test.mjs  # 29 API    (needs API on :3001)
node scripts/v2-flow-test.mjs       # 18 flow   (needs Vite on :3000)
node scripts/v3-consistency-test.mjs# 24 consistency (needs Vite on :3000)
npm run build
```

**Current baseline: tsc 0 errors, 53 / 29 / 18 / 24, build clean.**

The flow and consistency suites need both services running. If they print **nothing**, the
services are down — not the tests. This has been misdiagnosed as a regression more than once.

### Device testing

`scripts/device-presets.mjs` holds **18 real phone sizes** — iPhone SE through 16 Pro Max,
Galaxy S8 through S24 Ultra, Fold, plus Tecno, Infinix and Redmi at 360px. The widths where
layouts break are **320, 344 and 360**.

`logs/critique/_device-matrix.mjs` runs those against four pages and reports horizontal
overflow, clipped text and viewport escapes.

**Not a bug:** marquees and carousels extend past the viewport by design. A 1880px rail inside a
360px scroller is how a horizontal rail works.

## 10. What this product is not

Stated plainly, because pretending otherwise wastes time:

- **Not a native app.** It is a responsive web application.
- **Not backed by real merchants.** 640 of them are generated.
- **Not multi-tenant.** One catalogue, one instance.
- **Not payment-integrated.** Checkout is simulated.
- **Not migrated from the previous system.** The predecessor was a different stack with a
  different database; its 63 orders and 283 user tokens were **not** carried over.
- **Not finished on mobile.** See the handoff.
