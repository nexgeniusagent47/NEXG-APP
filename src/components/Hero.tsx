            LIGHT MODE HAS NO MOBILE IMAGE, so this one has to work at every size.

            Dark mode now has a dedicated landscape and portrait pair. Light mode has no
            equivalent — there is only `hero_daylight_resort`, a landscape composition —
            so on a phone it was being
            stretched into a portrait frame and cropped wherever `object-cover` happened to
            land. That is what the user saw: the light-mode image reading differently on a
            phone than on a desktop, with the subject lost off the edge.

            `object-position` is the honest fix available with one asset. A 16:9 frame squeezed
            into 9:19.5 keeps only about 29% of its width, so the centre is the wrong default:
            it discards the pool and the terrace on both sides. Anchoring mobile to 62%
            horizontal keeps the pool edge and the skyline, which are the parts that carry the
            image, and leaves the desktop framing untouched at 50%.

            If a portrait light-mode shot is ever supplied, add it here as a second
            ResponsiveImage with the same `sm` split dark mode already uses — that is the real
            fix, and this is the best that one landscape asset can do.

              ONE MARKUP, TWO SHAPES.

              Desktop keeps the approved two lines. Below `sm` the same two phrases are split
              into four, which lets the type be markedly larger: the size ceiling is set by the
              longest line, and the longest of four is 756 units against 961 for the longest of
              two — a 1.27x gain, measured. That is 38px instead of 30px on a 320px screen and
              47px instead of 37px at 390.

              The split is algorithmic rather than authored, because line breaks are not
              portable. `Intl.Segmenter` finds the break opportunities each language actually
              has — spaces for English, Swahili and Arabic, and the correct boundaries for
              Chinese, which has none. Hardcoding "Everything you / need" would produce a single
              unbroken Chinese line, since the whole phrase contains no space to break at.

              Both shapes are in the DOM and CSS decides which shows. Rendering one or the
              other in JS would mean a resize listener to swap them, and the layout would
              reflow visibly on rotation.

              TWO spacing decisions, both deliberate:

              `pl-[0.18em]` indents it very slightly from the headline's left edge. The
              indent is what signals that this line belongs TO the headline rather than
              being a sibling of it — the difference is small enough to read as
              intentional positioning rather than as a misalignment, which is the risk
              with any indent this shallow.

              `mt-6` against `mb-4` puts MORE space above than below, so the line groups
              downward with the search bar. Equal gaps had it floating between the two,
